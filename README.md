This is a Sea Battle Web Application. In Turkish we call: "Amiral Batti".

This is something I've been working on to test my abilities and more importantly brag about, ehm, I mean have fun.

There are plenty of things that need adjustment, however, you have to start somewhere, right?

If you want to see the application on use, visit https://morning-basin-13476.herokuapp.com/, where I host the server for this particular app.

This project uses node.js and server is hosted on Heroku.
